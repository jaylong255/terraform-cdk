# Terraform CDK
Experimenting with launching Terraform using CDKs.

Starting with Node because I like Node and I like TypeScript I would have been okay with Python too but the first blog/repo I came across uses Node and frankly there's a huge value in using TypeScript if it makes any sense at all. Most devs know some amount of TypeScript and all of us work with JavaScript in some capacity at some point so the learning curve is minimal.
